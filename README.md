# Advent of Code 2017

What you'll find here are my solutions to the 2017 Advent of Code puzzles. I will attempt to do these solutions in many
languages, so you can dive into each language directory to see what's there.

I will *not* attempt code-golf style solutions. Terse algorithms will be applied only when they're significant to the
language, such as Python's list comprehensions. I will also not settle for brute-force solutions just to get onto a
leaderboard sooner, tempting as that may be ;)

Also, inside [common/](./common) you will find the test input I received as well as notes for each puzzle with my
thoughts about the problems presented. These notes will include stuff like what CS concepts are presented by the puzzle,
ideas on time and space complexity, and so on.
