# Advent of Code 2017

What you'll find here are my solutions to the 2017 Advent of Code puzzles. I will attempt to do these solutions in many languages, so you can dive into each language directory to see what's there.

Also, inside [common/](./common) you will find the test input I received as well as notes for each puzzle with my thoughts about the problems presented. These notes will include stuff like what CS concepts are presented by the puzzle, ideas on time and space complexity, and so on.

Happy Coding, and Happy Holidays!
